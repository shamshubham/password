## Introduction

The "Password Strength Indicator" project provides users with visual feedback on the strength of their passwords as they type. This helps users create stronger passwords by offering immediate guidance on password length.

## Features

- **Real-Time Feedback**: Updates password strength status as the user types.
- **Color-Coded Indicators**: Displays different colors and messages based on password strength.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Provides clear and simple feedback to enhance user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the page (assumed to be in a `style.css` file).
- **JavaScript**: Handles the password strength calculation and updates the UI dynamically.
